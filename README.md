Project
===================
Idea-
----
Our idea is to make it possible for newly moved (in) adolescents/adults to grasp their budget by gaining an overview from the data they put in our application. Our application is based on information that you, as a customer type in where it will calculate your income and outcome, and therefore eventually give ideas on what you could potentially spend less money on and give otherwise general advice on handling your economy in a more sufficient way. 

Features-
-----
You can write in information about your economy, income and outcome such as: Food, clothing, loans, payment and so forth.
You will get advice on what to improve if your outcome is higher than the ones in our database(based on the general average of whatever income you may have, compared to the average of people with similar income) and you will see what is considered as a high outcome if you spend too much money in one category. Eventually, it will recommend depending on your former economical history in our database, comparing the current month(E.g. January) to the months December and October where you spent a lower amount of your currency on a specific category(E.g. clothes).

Examples are the following:

As the customer Mona-Lisa
I want to be able to view my income
So that I can see where the problem lies in my economy plan, and improve my economy for the future.
