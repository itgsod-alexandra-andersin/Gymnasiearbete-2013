Idea-
Our idea is to make it possible for newly moved (in) adolescents/adults to grasp their budget by gaining an overview from the data they put in our application. Our application is based on information that you, as a customer type in where it will calculate your income and outcome, and therefore eventually give ideas on what you could potentially spend less money on and give otherwise general advice on handling your economy in a more sufficient way.
